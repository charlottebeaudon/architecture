# architecture

Hello! I am Charlotte.

I collected here some architecture works that I produced during the last three years at the Akademie of Fine Arts in Vienna
I am currently looking for an internship in Vienna, if you are interested you can write me here: charlottebeaudon@free.fr

This is an experiment. Enjoy the navigation!
